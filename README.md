# What is this?
This is the front end portion of a web app on which personal friends were invited to leave encouraging comments for the creator.

# Deployment
Currently deployed using Nginx; for re-deploying (if I make any updates or something), read the instruction in the deploy.sh. 

# Etc
This app as of now doesn't have edit and delete functions, so I didn't bother writing those code.
But the backend side has all the routing for edit and delete functions, so if I desire I can come back later and add those features as well.
I don't really want to allow my friends to edit/delete each other's comments without any hindrance though.
